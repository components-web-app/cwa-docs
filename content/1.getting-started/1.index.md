![CWA Hello World](/images/screenshot.jpg)

The CWA provides you with a working framework to build de-coupled web apps. In the skeleton we provide an API where we have abstracted out the data structure for any website. This leaves a developer with only the job of creating the individual UI components and their associated data.

Because the data structure is predictable, we have build an advanced Nuxt module which provides a fully functional website and content management solution out of the box. We have also been able to provide so much advanced functionality that you can implement incredibly easily with just a few lines of code.

## Features

- API built on top of [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/) and [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)
- An advanced [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com) Module to provide the front-end and manage resource storage
- Easy to use traits, annotations and classes to extend for advanced functionality in the API
- VueJS composables which are super easy to use to provide you with all the functionality you might need in your front-end to display and manage your components via the API
- A powerful tech stack built in Docker for easy deployment
- A Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment
- Bash scripts and an example of how to use these in your CI/CD pipelines with GitLab
- And so much more...
