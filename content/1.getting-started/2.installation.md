## Quick Start

### 1. Clone our skeleton template

You will add your own code and configuration inside this skeleton.

__You can start a fresh new project with the [GitHub command line tool](https://cli.github.com/):__

```bash [Terminal]
gh repo create my-website --template="components-web-app/components-web-app" --private --clone
```

::callout
---
icon: i-simple-icons-github
target: _blank
to: https://github.com/new?template_name=components-web-app&template_owner=components-web-app
---
__or generate a GitHub repository from the template we provide__
::

::callout
---
icon: i-simple-icons-github
target: _blank
to: https://github.com/components-web-app/xcomponents-web-app
---
__or by downloading the Components Web App skeleton template__
::

::callout
---
icon: i-heroicons-light-bulb
---
__Note:__ Avoid downloading the .zip archive, as it may cause potential permission issues, prefer the .tar.gz archive.
::


### 2. Start docker containers

Open a terminal, and navigate to the directory containing your project skeleton. Run the following command to start all services using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

The following command will build the images (when they do not exist) and start them up in detached mode:
```bash [Terminal]
docker compose up --detach
```

::callout
---

Some other useful Docker Compose commands include:
- To stop the containers you can run `docker compose down`
- To view and follow logs you can run `docker compose logs -f [optional:container-name]`
- If you need to rebuild in future without the cache you can run `docker compose build --no-cache`

__See Docker documentation for more info.__

__This starts the following services:__

### 3. Create data fixtures
To create some default routes and fixtures so your template resembles our playground you can load the pre-build fixtures.
```bash [Terminal]
docker compose exec php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

### 4. Login page - Delete or modify
In the template, we have modified the login page to include a notice. You can simply delete the file at `/app/pages/login.vue` to use the default login page, or modify it to suit your needs using slots in our pre-built components, or using them as a guide.

### 5. Authentication Configuration

1. You need to create keys for generating JWT tokens. First you can bash into the php container
   ```bash [Terminal]
   docker compose exec php sh
   ```
1. Now you are writing in the command line within the php container. First create the JWT directory.
   ```bash [Terminal]
   mkdir -p config/jwt
   ```
1. Copy `api/.env` to `api/.env.local` - this will be your private environment variables and will not be pushed to your git repository.
1. Then find and change `JWT_PASSPHRASE` in your `api/.env.local` - this should always be a secret and you can use real environment variables in production. Note down the passphrase.
1. Generate the private key - when prompted, enter/paste the passphrase you noted down above.
   ```bash [Terminal]
   openssl genpkey -out config/jwt/private.pem -aes256 -algorithm rsa -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
   ```
1. Create the public key - again it will prompt you for the private key passphrase.
   ```bash [Terminal]
   openssl pkey -in config/jwt/private.pem -out config/jwt/public.pem -pubout
   ```

You have now created your JWT keys and will be able to login at `https://localhost/login`

We will be looking to provide support for other authentication systems in future. If you're interested, feel free to contribute.

### 6. Congratulations!

That's it! You can now start writing your components ðŸš€
