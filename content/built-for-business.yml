    description: |
      #### Foundation and discover
      Before starting the development of a website, it is essential to have a detailed plan of what you want the website to achieve and the overall content and structure, generally in the form of a wireframe, also know as a website blueprint. This can include a discover phase and defines the components needed once finalised.
      :br :br
      #### Design
      Once your wireframe has been defined, the look and feel of the site along with styles are developed by your designers including how the website will reflow on different screens. The resulting finalised UI kit is then handed over to the development team to get started.

      We’ve made the developer experience as simple as possible meaning your coders can breeze through creating components and scaffolding for the builder interface leaving the website ready for a non-developer to populate and arrange components. The developer sets up the project, builds the specific components and defines styles for the web app meaning the structure and content work can be assigned to an administrator with no coding knowledge.

      - title: Back-end
        description: Only basic php knowledge needed.
      - title: Styles
