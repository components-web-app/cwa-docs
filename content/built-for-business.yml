    description: |
      During the discovery phase, a manager will work with a client to build an understanding of requirements. Usually a plan is drawn up in the form of wireframes (also know as website blueprints) as user flows. <span class="text-primary-400 font-semibold">Each section within the blueprint can be considered a component that will need to be created.</span> Each with it's own specific purpose and requirements.

    description: |
      Once you have a blueprint, <span class="text-primary-400 font-semibold">the choice of style frameworks and UI kits is flexible and a business decision for you to make with your UI designer.</span> Each component can be designed with the branding and UI kit to the specification provided which can then be passed to the developer.
