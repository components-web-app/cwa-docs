        Your UI and UX design decisions are important which is why you are in complete control of what a website editor can modify. You create preset styles in-keeping with your client’s branding ensuring users’ of the system are restricted from hacking styles which haven’t been through the design process.
        Whether it is creating a new landing page for a marketing campaign or just adding more website content; you can be sure that their changes will work seamlessly with your design decisions.

      description: |
        The CWA has been built on the shoulders of giants providing maximum flexibility and extensibility. For the API, we chose to build on top of the incredibly powerful, well maintained and stable frameworks of Symfony and API Platform. You can extend their functionality further for services such as SAML authentication protocols or API proxies.
        For the front-end we decided to build a Nuxt module which is built on top of Vue.js. Creating front-end applications using Nuxt is a joy and the strong vibrant community behind all of these frameworks gives confidence and re-assurance your project will be secure and stable going on into the future.
